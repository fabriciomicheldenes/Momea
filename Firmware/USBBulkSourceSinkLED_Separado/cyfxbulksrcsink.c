/* This file illustrates the bulk source sink LED application example using the DMA MANUAL_IN
   and DMA MANUAL_OUT mode */

/*
   This example illustrates on how to configure the GPIO as an output and drive the LED.
   The LED will blink at 50ms rate if the FX3 DVK is connected to a SuperSpeed USB port. The LED
   will always turn ON if connected to a HighSpeed USB port and will be OFF of connected to a
   FullSpeed USB port. The user can also change the LED on-time and off-time by using the vendor
   command (0xAA). Refer to the FX3 DVK User-Guide on how to change the blinking rate of the LED
   using the vendor request.

   This example also illustrates USB endpoint data source and data sink mechanism. The example
   comprises of vendor class USB enumeration descriptors with 2 bulk endpoints. A bulk OUT
   endpoint acts as the producer of data and acts as the sink to the host. A bulk IN endpoint
   acts as the consumer of data and acts as the source to the host.

   The data source and sink is achieved with the help of a DMA MANUAL IN channel and a DMA
   MANUAL OUT channel. A DMA MANUAL IN channel is created between the producer USB bulk
   endpoint and the CPU. A DMA MANUAL OUT channel is created between the CPU and the consumer
   USB bulk endpoint. Data is received in the IN channel DMA buffer from the host through the
   producer endpoint. CPU is signaled of the data reception using DMA callbacks. The CPU
   discards this buffer. This leads to the sink mechanism. A constant pattern data is loaded
   onto the OUT Channel DMA buffer whenever the buffer is available. CPU issues commit of
   the DMA data transfer to the consumer endpoint which then gets transferred to the host.
   This leads to a constant source mechanism.

   The DMA buffer size is defined based on the USB speed. 64 for full speed, 512 for high speed
   and 1024 for super speed. CY_FX_BULKSRCSINK_DMA_BUF_COUNT in the header file defines the
   number of DMA buffers.
